          I'm Alex, a Junior Software Developer based in the Peak District. I've
          recently graduated from the Northcoders Software Developer bootcamp
          where I thoroughly enjoyed learning new techonologies at a fast pace
          and combining these skills with creative projects.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Before I found software development, I gained many years of
          professional experience working in the charity sector. Iâ€™m now looking
          forward to combining my new skills with my experience of working in
          digital marketing and communications.
